# Generic Object Decoding

This repository contains demo codes for replicating results in our paper: Horikawa, Kamitani "Generic decoding of seen and imagined objects using hierarchical visual features".
The generic object decoding approach enabled decoding of arbitrary object categories including those not used in model training. For more technical details, please refer to the paper: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06479>.

## Data (fMRI data and visual features)
The fMRI data for five subjects (training, test_perception, and test_imagery) and visual features (CNN1-8, HMAX1-3, GIST, and SIFT) are avairable from  <http://brainliner.jp/data/brainliner/Generic_Object_Decoding>. 

For copyright reasons, we do not make the visual images used in our experiments publicly available on our server. You can find the visual images from the ImageNet database <http://image-net.org/index> using the synset IDs and image IDs listed in imageID_training.csv and imageID_test.csv files. We will provide a script to automatically download images from the ImageNet in future.

## Demo code
